## Using Excel 

I wanted to calculate the growth percentage of crimes in each city ward between 2014 and 2020. I felt the easy way too achieve this was to use Excel.

I did this by using the growth percentage formula % increase = Increase รท Original Number ร 100.

Once I had the growth percentages calculated for each crime I exported the table out as CSV and imported it into Google Bigquery.
