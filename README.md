This analysis looks at the crime committed in Toronto, Ontario, from 2014 to 2020. I used SQL and EXCEL to aggregate data into total crimes committed by city Ward as well as growth percentages for each crime in each ward. Information on the SQL queries can be found in the SQL folder. Snapshots of the EXCEL work are located in the EXCEL folder.
